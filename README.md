## Why should I install this mod if I can just add W to Sprint in the `options.txt`?
1. W is removed from Sprint every time you rebind a control
2. You aren't able to stop sprinting with this method

# Usage Guide
1. Install [Amethyst](https://github.com/FrederoxDev/Amethyst-Launcher)
2. Open the Mod Manager in Amethyst Launcher, and click `Open Mods Folder`
3. Download the latest [ToggleSprint release](https://github.com/KingRocco21/Amethyst-ToggleSprint/releases)
4. Add [AmethystRuntime](https://github.com/FrederoxDev/Amethyst/releases/) and ToggleSprint to the mods folder
5. Extract them, and check for duplicate folders inside each mod.
6. Close and reopen Amethyst Launcher, open the `Profile Editor`, and create or edit a profile with AmethystRuntime and Amethyst-ToggleSprint enabled
7. Launch the game, and sprint should be toggled on by default.

## How do I change the sprint toggle keybind?
The keybind should be near the bottom of the `Keyboard & Mouse` settings. If it isn't, check to make sure you have the mod enabled in Amethyst Launcher.
